# Photorealistic Scene Augmentation Project
## University of Edinburgh Computer Graphics

### Overview
This project is a demonstration of photorealistic scene augmentation techniques, part of the coursework for the Computer Graphics class at the University of Edinburgh. The objective was to enhance a real photograph with 3D rendered objects and ensure the composite image maintained physical accuracy in lighting and shadows for a believable photorealistic output.

### Workflow
The project was structured into four main phases:

#### 1. Planning
- **Scene Capture**: Photographing the real-life scene and textures.
- **Documentation**: Recording the placement of objects and camera settings.

#### 2. Modeling
- **3D Modeling**: Creating the objects within the scene using 3D modeling software.
- **Camera Alignment**: Positioning the virtual camera to match the photographed scene.
- **Mesh Integration**: Adding a selected 3D mesh into the scene.

#### 3. Rendering
- **Scene Export**: Preparing the scene for photorealistic rendering.
- **PBRT Rendering**: Using PBRT (version 3) to render the scene.

#### 4. Compositing
- **Image Merging**: Combining the rendered 3D objects with the original photograph to finalize the augmented scene.
